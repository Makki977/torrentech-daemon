- 👋 Hi, I’m @trancephorm, also known as pyc or xphorm.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 technologies, P2P filesharing, cryptocurrencies and electronic music.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on migrating established private torrent tracker devoted to electronic music albums that is Torrentech.org, to be a fully decentralized Web3 website.
- 📫 You can reach me at @xphorm:matrix.org at Matrix chat/IM network.
