- 👋 Hi, I’m @trancephorm, also known as pyc or xphorm.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 technologies, P2P filesharing, cryptocurrencies and electronic music.
- 💞️ Looking for experienced developers to collaborate on migrating established private torrent tracker devoted to electronic music that is [Torrentech.org](http://www.torrentech.org), to be a fully decentralized mutiplatform application. MySQL data is already available and structured.
- 📫 You can reach me at @xphorm:matrix.org at Matrix chat/IM network.
